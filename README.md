## Carousel

The purpose of this homework is to leverage views, view properties, and events to create a high fidelity prototype that is difficult to distinguish from a production app. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement the Carousel app from the signed out state to the basic signed in state.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It's difficult to understand *why* I'm doing anything. The lab work we do in class is great for understanding how to do something, but I'd love to understand why I'm doing it more since it would help with understanding the homework.

* Any libraries or borrowed content.
